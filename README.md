Gridlock â€“ Interactive Puzzle Game
Your task is to create an interactive puzzle game for the game of Gridlock (Rush Hour, Traffic Jam), where the objective is for the player to resolve the gridlock and move a designated car (usually the red car) through the exit and off the board and out of the traffic jam. The standard playing area is a 6x6 grid and there is only one exit, on the third row from the top at the extreme right. As cars (of size 2) and trucks (of size 3) can only move along their row or column, the red car must be positioned on the same row as the exit. Naturally, cars and trucks cannot move anywhere unless there are free squares for them to move on to. Variations on the standard game could be to have multiple players, a variety of levels, different sorts of obstacles, the necessity to collect items, limiting the number of available moves, etc.

Two games are shown below. The first is a very easy puzzle, while the second is very difficult. The objective is to move the red car through the exit, which is at the right hand side of the board on the same row (the exit is obscured by the yellow and purple trucks in these images). Cars and trucks can only move horizontally or vertically along a row or column, and of course, only the red car can exit the board.
